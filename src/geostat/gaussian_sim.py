def fast_gaussian(dimension, sdev, corr, num_samples=1):
    """

    Generates random vector from distribution satisfying Gaussian variogram in dimension up to 3-d.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dimension : int
        Dimension of the grid.

    sdev : float
        Standard deviation.

    corr : float or array-like
        Correlation length, in units of block length.
        If a single float is provided, it represents the correlation length in all directions.
        If an array-like object with length 3 is provided, it represents the correlation length in the x-, y-, and z-directions.

    num_samples : int, optional
        Number of samples to generate. Default is 1.
        If greater than 1, the function will return an array of shape (dimension, num_samples).

    Returns
    -------
    x : array-like
        The generated random vectors of shape (dimension, num_samples).

    Notes
    -----
    The parametrization of the grid is assumed to have size dimension, if dimension is a vector,
    or [dimension,1] if dimension is scalar. The coefficients of the grid is assumed to be reordered
    columnwise into the parameter vector. The grid is assumed to have a local basis.

    Example of use:

    Want to generate a field on a 3-d grid with dimension m x n x p, with correlation length a along first coordinate
    axis, b along second coordinate axis, c alone third coordinate axis, and standard deviation sigma:

    x=fast_gaussian(np.array([m, n, p]),np.array([sigma]),np.array([a b c]))

    If the dimension is n x 1 one can write

    x=fast_gaussian(np.array([n]),np.array([sigma]),np.array([a]))

    If the correlation length is the same in all directions:

    x=fast_gaussian(np.array([m n p]),np.array([sigma]),np.array([a]))

    The properties on the Kronecker product behind this algorithm can be found in
    Horn & Johnson: Topics in Matrix Analysis, Cambridge UP, 1991.

    Note that we add a small number on the diagonal of the covariance matrix to avoid numerical problems with Cholesky
    decomposition (a nugget effect).

    Also note that reshape with order='F' is used to keep the code identical to the Matlab code.

    The method was invented and implemented in Matlab by Geir NÃ¦vdal in 2011.
    Memory-efficient implementation for batch generation of samples was added in 2025.
